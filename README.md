# Python Chess Engine

Hello, this is a project to create a chess engine in python with an interface via the command line

# Aims

- To become more confident with software engineering in python
- Have fun
- Practice unit testing in python
- Develop my software engineering skills

## Functional requirements
- Two players should be able to play against each other using the command line
- Each player should exchange turns until there is as check mate
- Should follow all modern rules of chess
- Should display the current scores for each player (as per Chess.com) 1=pawn, 3=knights, 3=bishops, 4=rook, 9=queen
- Should support en passant capturing!
- Should support castling

## Quality requirements
- Should be well tested so it isn't obnoxiously buggy
- Should priortise good software engineering practices over speed!, makes it alot easier to debug
